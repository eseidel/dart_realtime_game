# shimmer2
 Attempt #2 at playing with full-stack realtime Dart.


# MVP
- Make docker container
- Push to somewhere.

# Issues
- Do server transmissions need to be marked volatile?
- Make server only do something when clients are connected?
- VSC doesn't surface analyzer issues in shimmer2_shared code.


# Next
- Make entities move somewhere over time.
- Make it possible to set a color from the client.
- Make it possible to set a name from the client.
